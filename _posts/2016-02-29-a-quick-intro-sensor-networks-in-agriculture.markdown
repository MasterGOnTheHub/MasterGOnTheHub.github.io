title: A quick intro - sensor networks in agriculture
layout: post
---
As this is my final year of my honours program, I get to do an engineering project! What the project is aboutÂ has been mostly up to me, but my supervisor and Uni will have to approve the project of course.

I have decided to look into sensor networks in agriculture, which is a fancy way of saying that I want to measure a bunch of stuff happening on the farm and be able to make decisions or alert the farmer that it is happening.
For my project, I am hoping to get this up and running on a vineyard here in Queensland, I will make the system and get it running and the vineyard gets to see how this kind of technology will benefit them.

The most important things I want to measure, are temperature and humidity (in and around the vines), soil moisture and possibly a few others like soil alkalinity. These little sensors will be in amongst the vines and will send their data up to the farmstead where the information can be used. For a start, if the temperature in the soil or by the vines drops too far in the night, the farmer may want a text message warning. Soil moisture will similarly trigger warnings, or perhaps kick off the irrigation system automatically.

This will all be down the line, and I have to start somewhere. So for now, I am looking to get the vineyard partner on board and I will start to plan the pieces of the puzzle. Lot's of updates to come!
